# RGB-Based-Tifinagh-Handwritten-Character-Classification-with-a-Multiclass-Neural-Network
A neural network model (MLP) is used to classify handwritten Tifinagh characters from RGB images. The approach achieves high accuracy and shows that raw RGB inputs can be effectively processed without manual features.
